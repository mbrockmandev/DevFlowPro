## Features

Currently, DevFlowPro is connected to a MongoDB with Express, NodeJS, and features a React UI. Users may add, edit, or delete tickets as needed. JWT is used to verify a user has authenticated with the system. 

Future plans include:
-Swagger-style UI for testing the API from the front end
-Draggable tickets
-Filtering/Sorting tickets
-Customizable ticket interface per user
-Appending screenshots to tickets
-Admin features, such as assigning tickets to developers, removing/reassigning users to different roles, etc. 
-More robust safety checking, e.g., limiting access based on role
